# Calliope
### *"A second brain for your second world"*
Calliope is a free and open-source productivity app designed primarily for fantasy game masters.

Designing your own world is tough. Making it believable and consistent is nearly impossible, but tools like Calliope aim to make it more feasible to improve you and your players' experiences with your world.

Calliope is built on 4 core tenets: ease of use, speed, and accessibility.
1. **Easy to use, and easy to master**
	There's nothing worse than being mid-brain blast and stumbling into some technical issue or unintuitive design that stops you in your tracks. Calliope aims to be intuitive, consistent, and uninterruptive.
2. **Your hands are fast, but your brain is faster**
	Your note-taking environment should be an extension of your mind. The more fluid and rapid that connection is, the better notes you'll keep and the more creative you can be.
3. **Freedom of form**
	Not everyone keeps notes the same ways, why should a note-keeping application try to force one format on everyone uniformly? You know what works best for you, and Calliope can help support it.
4. **Built for everyone!**
	Being open-source and free was a natural choice. Calliope is built to help you build your ideas. If your ideas can help build Calliope, it will only benefit us all!

### Here's What Calliope Has To Offer You
Calliope is designed to let you take notes the way you want them, not to force you into some alien format. Instead, it offers an additional set of innovative tools to improve your note-taking and note-reading experience, both out-of-game when you have time to dream and in-game when you need to recall something fast.

> **Auto-Backlinking**
> If you haven't used backlinking before, you'll quickly see why it has grown so rapidly over the last few years. Wiki-style notes allow you to quickly reference related subjects. Calliope can backlink your notes for you (at your discretion!) to make tying elements of your world together fast and effortless.

> **Interactive Mapping**
> The geography of your world can inform its history more strongly than anything else. An interactive map highlighting civilizations, landmarks, vistas, and more can help you immerse yourself in the fantasy.

> **Visual Reference**
> The inhabitants of your world - be they evil minions or citizens of the realm - have their own cultures! Add pictures to your notes to keep further your immersion when developing cities, towns, or evil lairs.

> **Smart Search**
> It's the 21st century. As humans, we're intrinsically bound to search engines. A smart and powerful search engine with quick-find features makes recalling knowledge from your second brain just as fast as you can type the query.

### Save The World! (Literally)
Calliope is designed around portability, meaning you can bring your notes with you anywhere and update them at any time. Built-in cloud storage options and version control utilities let you keep your notes right where you want them and update them automatically or manually.

### Techno-Blah-Blah (For the Nerds)
Calliope is built in C++14 on the Qt framework. I strive to keep the code clear, well-documented, and adherent to best-practices of object-oriented software design, but there's always room for improvement. Email me at [iangradert@gmail.com](mailto:iangradert@gmail.com) if you would like to contribute.
